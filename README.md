# SME-Profit-Analysis-and-Predictive-Models

## 🚀 Project: Predictive Modeling for SME Profit Analysis

This project explores the factors influencing SME profitability using advanced data analysis and predictive modeling techniques. Key steps include:

1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Redundant variables were removed, categorical variables transformed, and numeric variables normalized.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): R&D Spend shows a strong positive relationship with Profit, while Administration and Marketing Spend have weaker effects.

3️⃣ Predictive Modeling: A multiple linear regression model revealed R&D Spend as the most significant predictor of Profit, with an Adjusted R² of 96%.

4️⃣ Feature Selection & PCA: Techniques like forward, backward, and stepwise selection reinforced the importance of R&D Spend. PCA highlighted two components explaining 92.46% of the variance.

Highlights:

📊 Visualizations: Correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, and residual diagnostics.

📈 Modeling: Strong fit with interpretable results emphasizing R&D investments.
